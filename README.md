# digit-recognition-nn

In this project I implemented deep neural network algorithms for digit recognition. I used deep neural network in part2-nn, then I sued PyTorch to make the classification in part2-mnist, Finally I boosted the performance using the convolutional layers in part2-mnist.

**The project files are as follow:**
```
part2-nn/neural_nets.py in which I implemented your first neural net from scratch
part2-mnist/nnet_fc.py where I started using PyTorch to classify MNIST digits
part2-mnist/nnet_conv.py where I used convolutional layers to boost performance
part2-twodigit/mlp.py and part2-twodigit/conv.py which are for a new, more difficult version of the MNIST dataset
```
